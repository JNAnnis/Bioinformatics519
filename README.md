# Bioinformatics519

ABOUT: This contains the code I wrote for the class BCH/BIO 519: Introduction to Bioinformatics. All code is labeled as HW#_ and details of each homework are as follows:

HW2 Code: 4 separate files that perform various basic operations on DNA sequences

HW3 Code: miRNA code creates a table containing which miRNAs have the highest binding potential with a given DNA sequence (FASTA format); kmer code finds all k-mers of a given length across all input DNA sequences (FASTA format)

HW5 Code: Creates dot plot alignments of two sequences (FASTA format). The only difference between dotplot1 and dotplot2 is that 2 requires two imput parameters, a window size and a cutoff

HW6 Code: Both scripts are used to analyze the results obtained from running BLAST

HW7: Uses bedtools to analyze bed files containing alignment results and creates a tab-delineated file containing the number of gene reads

HW8: Finds open reading frames (ORFs) in a given DNA sequence (FASTA format)

HW9: wordcount code finds all 7-mers in given sequences; greedy code implements a greedy algorithm to find a motif of length 7 from a given sequence (Not FASTA format, only sequence in txt file)
